// Difficulty Rating:  200

// Solution:

//Explanation:
/*I simply asked the user to input the number and 
then simply printed the number. I didn't wrote "Enter the number: "
because the CodeChef test case was not passing it. I just simply 
left the blank space in the first print statement.*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	int num;
	printf(" ");
	scanf("%d", &num);
	printf("%d", num);
	return 0;
}
